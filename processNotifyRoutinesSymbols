# This works on newer debugger builds to print the symbols for each registered routine with the syntax: (void(*)()).
# The structure is not documenting so I'm hardcoding the offset of the routine pointer inside the callback block (offset 8).
# Notice that the pointers need to be alined since they encode a reference number.
